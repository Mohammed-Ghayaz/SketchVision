# **SketchVision Web Application**

## **Overview**

This project is a web application that transforms images into **pencil sketches** using OpenCV. Users can upload an image, and the application processes it to produce a pencil sketch effect, which can then be downloaded or shared.

---

## **Features**

- Simple and intuitive web interface for uploading images.
- Real-time transformation of images into pencil sketches.
- Option to download or share the transformed images.
- Supports multiple image formats such as PNG, JPG, and JPEG.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Image Upload:**
   - Users upload an image through the web interface.
2. **Processing with OpenCV:**
   - The uploaded image is converted to grayscale.
   - Gaussian blur is applied to smoothen the image.
   - A blend of the original and inverted blurred image is created to produce the sketch effect.
3. **Output:**
   - The processed pencil sketch is displayed on the web interface.

## **Future Plans**

- Integrate AI-based models to transform images into **cartoon** or **anime-style** illustrations.  
- Add support for additional artistic effects such as **watercolor**, **oil painting**, and **pop art**.  
- Provide advanced features like **batch processing** of images and **cloud-based processing** for larger files.  
- Develop a mobile application version for easier accessibility and usability.  
- Enable social media integration for direct sharing of transformed images.
